Client Side Static Assets
========

/css holds the compiled client side style sheets.
<br />
/img holds static image assets used in the game scripts for rendering the game
background and entities.

/js holds the client side scripts that handle the rendering of the game for
each client and the sending of the input to the server. The client sends intents
in the form of JSON Objects to the server.
